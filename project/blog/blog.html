      <h3><b>Publishing for an Ornithologist</b></h3>
      <h5>Journals for Ornithologist, <span class="w3-opacity">February 06, 2023</span></h5>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Ornithologists have several options for publishing their research papers, including traditional publishing and open access publishing.
<br> Traditional publishing, also known as subscription publishing, involves submitting a paper free of charge to a journal that is then peer-reviewed and, if accepted, published in print or online. Access to these articles is restricted and requires a subscription, often through academic institutions or libraries. Users have to pay to access.</br>
<br> Open access publishing, on the other hand, is an alternative to traditional publishing that provides immediate, online access to articles without the need for a subscription. In this model, authors typically pay a fee called Article processing charge, usually very expensive ($1000 above) to make their article freely available to the public. While open access is intended to make research more widely accessible, it can still be challenging for some authors to pay the fees associated with open access publishing.
It's worth mentioning that open access publishing is not always truly "cheap" in the sense that the author still has to pay to make their work publicly accessible. This financial burden can make open access publishing inaccessible for some researchers.</br>
<br>In the field of ornithology, some of the top 20 journals for publishing research include
Journal of Avian Biology, The Auk: Ornithological Advances, Ibis, Condor, Bird conservation international, Journal of ornithology, Avian Conservation and Ecology, Emu-Austral Ornithology, Journal of raptor research, Avian Research, Journal of field ornithology, Wilson Journal of Ornithology, Bird study, Ostrich, Ardeola-International Journal of Ornithology, Journal of avian medicine and surgery, Ardea, Waterbirds, Acta Ornithologica and finally Avian Biology Research. These journals have established reputations and rigorous peer-review processes, making them highly regarded in the ornithological community. However, they are all available through the traditional method or a huge open access fee.</br>
<br>Looking ahead, the future of publishing in ornithology may involve "Platinum access," in which neither the author nor the reader pays for access to articles. This model is still in its infancy, but holds promise for making research more widely available and accessible for all. Authors submit articles freely and readers have access immediately. The cost still exists but is taken up by funders and big institutions that can afford it.</br>
<br>Below are three journals that offer platinum access, Web Ecology, impact factor of 1.545, Perspectives In Ecology And Conservation, impact factor of 3.563 and Vertebrate Zoology with impact factor of 1.757. </br>
<br>In conclusion, ornithologists have several options for publishing their research papers, including traditional publishing and open access publishing. While open access is intended to make research more widely accessible, it still requires the author to pay a fee. Top journals in ornithology include The Auk, The Condor, and others. Platinum access is a promising future for publishing in ornithology, where neither the author nor the reader has to pay for access to articles.</br>
