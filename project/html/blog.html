      <h3><b>APLORI in my view</b></h3>
      <h5>Being an Ornithologist, <span class="w3-opacity">October 30, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>APLORI!, the popular name of the A.P. Leventis Ornithological Institute, in this short write up I will describe my experience so far studying Ornithology and the institute. Well starting from the beginning, I knew this was the foremost institute for ornithology in the whole of West Africa, I knew so many greats had passed through this place, in fact my introduction to Aplori back in 2015 came through a former student of Aplori. It has really been an exhausting journey but all worthwhile, the lecturers I have met here are some of the bests in the world at what they do, my class mates and the Nigerian community have all been so welcoming especially as I am a foreigner in the country. We went on bird walks each morning for six months, wow, it was not easy but we sailed through. After exams I thought I was free for a while, but the stress of proposal write-up set in. Any new study will laugh at the thought of Aplori being stressful, I know this because I thought they were just exaggerating when they said that, well I have experienced it the hard way. I believe that is what makes student who pass out of here standard. The system will fine tune you to becoming a great conservationist, I can certainly confirm this.</p>

      <p>The Hooded vulture, my selected species of interest, it’s amazing how I have developed so much fondness for a species. As an Ornithologist, I hope to contribute towards improving their status locally in my country Ghana. This will go a long way to help the species.</p>

      <h3><b>My Childhood Bird Experience</b></h3>
      <h5>Birds, <span class="w3-opacity">October 30, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Growing up as a child in Ayikoayikoo, a suburb in Cape Coast, in the Central Region, a region in the Southern part of Ghana overlooking the Gulf of Guinea it was really interesting. In my native community as a child, I witnessed a lot of species although at the time I didn’t know about them, in retrospect knowing about the Hooded Vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus) called pɛtɛ in my local language, I wish I could have seen more of it as they have drastically reduced now, back then I could see so many individuals at dump sites also behind my house was a small forest patch that had no clear ownership about 14217 square meters in size. Because this area was undeveloped in a large urban area, many number of species occupied it, I would not know of the smaller species however, I can vividly recall the Hooded Vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus) , the Pied Crow (Colvus albus) called Anene in my local language and the Yellow-billed Kite (Milvus migrans parasitus) possibly because they were large and very conspicuous however, when I factor in occasional visits to my grandmothers place also in the Central Region but several kilometres away from our house, I recall constantly asking her to get me a bird. Even at that age I was so obsessed about birds that I wanted one to keep as a pet. Though it might not have been a great to keep on as a pet that is restricting its movement, however, it is no surprise that today I am seated in the lecture room in an institution focused on birds. Back to the story, at my grandmothers’ I witnessed a group of birds with so many nests made of strands of dried leaves, now I know they are some species of weavers. In my own community I found how people related with one species in particular, the Pied crow (Corvus albus). Crows were persecuted because they were seen as a nuisance, it usually stole food and even bars of soap from unsuspecting residents in the community. I recall several constructions erected, as a crucifixion cross and some Pied Crows (Corvus albus) killed where crucified on the cross as a deterrent to others from causing harm. I could never miss the black and white colouration on the dead bird as I looked up. </p>
