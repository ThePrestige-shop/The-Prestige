        <p>APLORI!, the popular name of the A.P. Leventis Ornithological Institute, in this short write up I will describe my experience so far studying Ornithology at the institute. Well starting from the beginning, I knew this was the foremost institute for ornithology in the whole of West Africa, I knew so many greats had passed through this place, in fact my introduction to Aplori back in 2015 came through a former student of Aplori. It has really been an exhausting journey but all worthwhile, the lecturers I have met here are some of the bests in the world at what they do, my class mates and the Nigerian community have all been so welcoming especially as I am a foreigner in the country. We went on bird walks each morning for six months, wow, it was not easy but we sailed through. After exams I thought I was free for a while, but the stress of proposal write-up set in. Aplori is stressful, I know this because I have experienced it myself. I believe that is what makes student who pass out of here standard. The system will fine tune you into becoming a great conservationist, I can certainly confirm this.</p>
